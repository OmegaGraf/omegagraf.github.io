# OmegaGraf

## What is OmegaGraf?

OmegaGraf is a simple, easy to use deployment tool for vCenter monitoring.

## Why would I want to use OmegaGraf?

Setting up a monitoring solution manually takes lots of time, and lots of tweaking. The more time admins spend on setting up monitoring solutions, the less time they're spending on other projects. OmegaGraf makes System Administrators' lives easier by supplying a simple, fast solution to get monitoring deployed in under five minutes.

## What do I need to do to deploy?

All you need to do is run the executable and visit the URL provided, then give credentials when added.
