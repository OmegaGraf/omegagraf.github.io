</p>

## What do I need to get started?

- Linux or Windows environment
- Docker (Community Edition)
- One or more vCenter environments *
- About 5 minutes of free time

\* If you do not have or want to use a real vCenter environment, we offer to deploy a simulator using [vcsim](https://github.com/OmegaGraf/docker-vcsim).

## What do I need to do to deploy?

If you have a fresh Debian install, you can get started with OmegaGraf by using our installation script.

You must run as a user with sudo *privileges* for package installs. *Do not run with sudo or as root.*

```
bash <(curl -s {{ site.github.repository_raw }}/install/debian-amd64.sh)
```

Otherwise, you can use our [Getting Started]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) guide.
